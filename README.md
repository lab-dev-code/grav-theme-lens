Lens is a simple [Grav](grav) theme, originally designed by [HTML5 UP][html5-up].

# Installation

Installing the Lens theme can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the theme with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

## GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)][grav-gpm] through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install lens

This will install the Lens theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/lens`.

## Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `lens`. You can find these files either on [GitHub][homepage] or via [GetGrav.org][grav-themes].

You should now have all the theme files under

    /your/site/grav/user/themes/lens

# Updating

## GPM Update (Preferred)

The simplest way to update this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)][grav-gpm]. You can do this with this by navigating to the root directory of your Grav install using your system's Terminal (also called command line) and typing the following:

    bin/gpm update lens

This command will check your Grav install to see if your Lens theme is due for an update. If a newer release is found, you will be asked whether or not you wish to update. To continue, type `y` and hit enter. The theme will automatically update and clear Grav's cache.

## Manual Update

Manually updating Lens is pretty simple. Here is what you will need to do to get this done:

* Delete the `your/site/user/themes/lens` directory.
* Download the new version of the lens theme from either [GitHub][homepage] or [GetGrav.org][grav-themes].
* Unzip the zip file in `your/site/user/lens` and rename the resulting folder to `lens`.
* Clear the Grav cache. The simplest way to do this is by going to the root Grav directory in terminal and typing `bin/grav clear-cache`.

> Note: Any changes you have made to any of the files listed under this directory will also be removed and replaced by the new set. Any files located elsewhere (for example a YAML settings file placed in `user/config/themes`) will remain intact.
